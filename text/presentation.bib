	abstract = {The introduction of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to the public has provided millions of people with navigation and positioning services around the globe. However, it is known that no matter the improvements to accuracy, fundamentally, GPS cannot provide location information in extreme environments, such as underwater and underground. Hence, there is a growing need for alternative technologies and methodologies of providing localization in such extreme or GPSless environments. This paper introduces a low-power and lowcost substitute founded on Long Range (LoRa) to realize similar localization capabilities, based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) techniques. LoRa transceivers support swift deployment in GPS-less emergency scenarios, providing emergency teams with critical location and sensing data. According to outdoor experimental results, LoRa is a promising solution for wireless localization systems at GPS-less environments.},

The proposed hardware is generic, and it can estimate the AoA of any received signal that is operating at a frequency below 2.7 GHz. However, we have validated its performance with LoRa signals that are operating at the 868 MHz frequency band. The experimental validation, which has been conducted in a controlled environment, reveals that the proposed system can estimate the AoA of the received signals from various azimuth angles with median and maximum estimation errors of 4 and 14 degrees, respectively.},

Real Time Kinematic (RTK) is a promising technology to achieve centimeter precision in GNSS, however it requires radio communication and to reduce power consumption this is done at meters range, reducing the use in navigation systems. In this work, we present a high precision low power systems that can be energetically autonomous. The proposed approach exploits a GNSS module with RTK combined with a long-range communication radio (LoRa) to achieve a high-precision localization system with minimal wireless radio infrastructure requirements. Wireless sensor nodes, designed to be energy efficient, comprise the system and they include a solar energy harvesting for self-sustainability. Preliminary experimental results, with in-field measurements, show an average accuracy below 1 meter up to more than 1km distance of the end-node from the geostationary reference anchor; with a peak accuracy of only 10cm. Low power consumption is also presented with in-filed measurements.},

The reliability and usability of such systems are highly based on their accuracy as well as cost and ease of deployment. Although the Global Positioning System (GPS) is an accurate solution for outdoor use, it can not be used indoors. A popular approach is a wireless navigation system which makes use of Received Signal Strength Indicators (RSSI). However, signal propagation, as well as surrounding noise and a dynamic environment, can affect their performance. Recent advancements in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and the introduction of small and inexpensive beacons can alleviate the problem. In this work, we introduce an indoor navigation system with BLE beacons. To measure system accuracy an Android application was developed to collect the signal. Moreover, a Kalman filter was also developed within the application to improve the accuracy. Experimental results showed improvement of systems accuracy in three square topologies. The Kalman filter improved the accuracy up to 78.9\%. while the experiments also show a correlation between the overall accuracy and how close BLE beacons are to each other.},

	abstract = {The last few years have seen a rapid expansion within the area of the Internet ofThings (IoT). For many IoT applications, such as asset tracking and distributedsensor networks, the problem of localization (i.e. determining the physical loca-tion of nodes in the network) is fundamental. For such applications, constraintson size, cost, and power consumption often prohibit the use of GPS. This thesisdesigns, implements, and evaluates a GPS-free localization system using the LongRange Radio (LoRa) technology, built using low cost off-the-shelf hardware. Thesystem is based on combining Time of Flight (ToF) and Received Signal StrengthIndicator (RSSI) distance measurements using a weighted multilateration estima-tor. By using an accelerometer that detects significant movement, subsequentmeasurements made in the same place can be leveraged to provide increased ac-curacy. The evaluation shows that the hybrid system outperforms both ToF andRSSI used on their own, achieving a mean stationary position error of 272 meters,which is comparable to other LoRa localization techniques.},

Most of the range-based localization algorithms proposed made use of the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) to make an estimation of the distance between transmitter and receiver. Based on our experiments, there is no relationship between RSSI and distance in indoor situations. But the outdoor experiments show that RSSI is closely related with distance, direction of antenna, the height of nodes above the ground and obstructions. The Gaussian model by curve fitting the average RSSI value with distance resulted the formulation that can be used to compute the distance between unknown node and its neighboring nodes. Then, by applying Trilateration method, a localization system was implemented. This system are specially designed for outdoor without obstructions, tiny variance of physical conditions and all sensor nodes should be placed 2 meters higher than playground. Finally, some errors were analyzed in detail and corresponding proposals were given.},

New use cases are being created by the need for it and feasibility to provide it, with low-cost solutions. As a key enabler of the IoT, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is gaining great attention in research and industry. It provides a desirable solution for applications that require hundreds or thousands of actively connected devices to monitor a process or an environment or to assist in controlling a certain process. Some of these IoT use cases require having the location information of the IoT devices. In some cases, localization can be the intrinsic purpose of deployment. In this regard, the received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based localization offers a feasible and affordable solution. Since LoRaWAN has only been there for only a few years, research on utilizing LoRaWAN RSSI for localization purposes is in early stages and is scarce. In this paper, we study LoRaWAN RSSI-based localization and evaluate its accuracy, impairments, and prospects. In addition, we employ the use of software-defined radios (SDR) into our work for the purpose of path-loss characterization. The experimental results revealed the fact that a high variance of RSSI due to frequency hopping feature of LoRaWAN could severely impact the localization performance. Potential solutions are developed and presented to reduce this negative impact, hence improve the performance.},

We use a publicly available outdoor LoRaWAN data set to evaluate Received Signal Strength fingerprint-based and range-based location estimation algorithms in terms of accuracy and computational performance. On the one hand, a fingerprint-based approach leads to 50\% more accurate results when compared to a range-based approach, resulting in mean location estimation errors of 340m and 700m, respectively. On the other hand, in a range-based approach, no training database is required and the system can be deployed instantly in any environment with network coverage.

	abstract = {Tracking of goods, containers, and vehicles in harbors is a challenging task because seaports typically are in a secluded area with limited networking capability. Existing solutions use the combination of RFID tagging and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). A harbor is considered a harsh industrial environment with metallic components and surfaces. These conditions inﬂuence the wireless networking performance. In addition, harbors’ areas vary from 500 ha to 7500 ha. Hence, the coverage range of wireless systems and the exposition to interference are considered. LoRa (Long Range) technology becomes a promising solution among other Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). Therefore, we investigate the LoRa technology to locate and track assets in harbors. Through ns3 simulations on scalability, interval rate, and coverage range performance metrics, we evaluated the feasibility to use LoRa in seaports. In our experiments, we applied 1000 LoRa nodes within a radius of 2500 m to the gateway. The results exhibit a probability of successful transmission of 85\% in an interval of 300 sec.},

However, forecasts of mass application of consumer IoT system have stimulated the development of new wireless technologies that may also be interesting for industry. In this paper, the LoRa technology is investigated for the implementation of industrial wireless networks suitable for sensors and actuators of the Industry 4.0 era. After a brief overview of LoRa and LoRaWAN, the paper deals with the discussion about using LoRa for industrial applications compared to traditional industrial wireless systems. With only very light modifications to the upper layer of LoRaWAN communication stack, a time slot channel hopping schema is possible. The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approach, which is compatible with requirements of soft real-time applications in process industry.

advancements provides people handheld devices and indoor robots, which increase

use the technology for Indoor Localization, we study its ranging performance with
several LoRa modulation parameters considering different scenarios.
In this thesis, we present a ranging evaluation system and indoor localization system.
The evaluation system enriches us with suitable LoRa parameter for indoor envi-
ronments and further used to achieve positioning in indoor localization system. Our
evaluation gives a brief perspective about LoRa modulation parameters in different
scenarios. Also, the indoor localization system’s performance is largely dependent
on ranging performance of LoRa devices. Additionally, our evaluation shows that

	abstract = {Smartphone devices can play a key role on emergency scenarios thanks to their pervasiveness, and the possibility to convey emergency requests from the involved people to the rescue teams. At the same time, the effective utilization of such devices on critical scenarios with limited mobile Internet access is challenging. As an alternative, several recent research studies have proposed Emergency Communication System (ECS) based on short-range Device-to-Device (D2D) solutions available on Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) devices (e.g. Wi-Fi Direct); however, the target of these solutions is constituted by small indoor areas, since the scalability on large-scale environments is often a problem. In this paper, we overcome such issue by proposing LOCATE, a novel phone-based ECS enabling long-range communication among survivors and rescue teams over critical environments where 3/4G cellular connectivity is not available and the traditional geo-localization technologies (e.g. the GPS) provide only partial coverage of the environment. The proposed system consists of a mobile application connected to a LoRa transceiver via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); through the app, users can send emergency requests that are re-broadcasted by other peers until reaching a rescue personnel who is able to handle the emergency. Three novel contributions are provided in this paper. First, we provide extensive measurements of the LoRa technology, and investigate its suitability for ECS-related applications. Second, we describe the LOCATE prototype and the enabling algorithms; specifically, we propose a novel multi-hop dissemination algorithm which maximizes the probability to deliver an emergency request to the destination (e.g. rescue personnel) within a user-defined temporal threshold, while minimizing the number of message re-transmissions. Third, we extensively evaluate the LOCATE performance through OMNeT++ simulations, assessing the capability of the dissemination protocol to spread out the emergency requests over large-scale scenarios, and through experiments, assessing the capability of LoRa-based trilateration technique to provide accurate GPS-free localization. The results demonstrate that the LOCATE protocol is able to minimize the time required to handle the emergency when compared to other dissemination strategies (e.g. flooding, continuous, once-per-contact), and they highlight the considerable improvement provided by the LoRa technology over other D2D solutions available on COTS smartphones (e.g. Wi-Fi Direct).},

	abstract = {Maritime communications are really challenging due to the adverse transmission conditions and the lack of a pre-provided infrastructure for supporting long range connectivity with land. Communications in high seas are usually covered by satellite links that are expensive and lead to high power consumption by the terminals. However, in areas closer to the shore, other communication options have been adopted for different kinds of services such as boat tracking and telemetry, data collection from moored monitoring systems, etc. In these scenarios, technologies such as cellular communications or wireless sensor networks have been employed so far; nevertheless, all of them present different drawbacks mostly related with the coverage and energy-efficiency of the system. Recently, a novel communication paradigm, so-called Low Power-Wide Area Network (LP-WAN) has gained momentum due to its interesting characteristics regarding transmission distances and end-node’s power consumption. The latter may be of great interest for ships with energetic restrictions such as small sailboats, recreational boats, or radio control ships. For that reason, in this work, we present a boat tracking and monitoring system based on LoRa (Long Range), one of the most prominent LP-WAN technologies. We provide a comprehensive overview of this communication solution as well as a discussion addressing its benefits when applied to maritime scenarios. We present the results extracted from a case of study, where real-training sessions of Optimist Class sailboats have been monitored by means of the presented architecture, obtaining good levels of coverage and link-reliability with limited power consumption. A transmission range study is also presented, demonstrating the validity of this proposal for monitoring activities inside the port or maneuvers close to the shore.},

Considering that traditional IoT positioning technology cannot balance the cost, energy consumption, and positioning performance well, a Wide-Area Positioning System Based on Long Range Mesh (LoRaWAPS), which is a low-cost and low-power outdoor positioning system with multi-anchor wireless mesh networking and multi-dimensional data fusion, is designed in this paper. To meet the need for a positioning system, a low-power consumption and high-reliability LoRa Mesh protocol is proposed. Aiming at the problem that the accuracy of LoRa ranging is easily affected by the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) path propagation of signals, a distance estimation algorithm based on the fusion of time of flight (TOF) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) multi-sampling data is proposed. Furthermore, a position estimation algorithm is designed to minimize the posteriori RSSI error for multi-anchor cooperative estimation scenarios. Furthermore, the prototype of LoRaWAPS is built and tested in the campus environment. The experimental results show that the proposed system can provide reliable location service with low power and low cost.},

The algorithm, through a comprehensive examination of the phase change patterns, amalgamated with arrival angle data and signal amplitude characteristics, effectively estimates the precise location of the target. Experimental validations underscore the algorithm’s efficacy in determining the target’s location during continuous walking activity.

These sensors form a network named as wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to monitor physical environment and disseminate collected data back to the base station through multiple hops. WSN has the capability to collect and report data for a specific application. The location information plays an important role for various wireless sensor network applications. A majority of the applications are related to location-based services. The development of sensor technology, processing techniques, and communication systems give rise to a development of the smart sensor for the adaptive and innovative application. So a single localization technique is not adequate for all application. In this paper, a recent extensive analysis of localization techniques and hierarchical taxonomy and their applications in the different context is presented. This taxonomy of the localization technique is classified based on presence of offline training in localization, namely self-determining and training dependent approaches. Finally, various open research issues related to localization schemes for IoT are compared and various directions for future research are proposed.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a RSSI-based distance estimation scheme for localization of cattle collars communicating with long-range LoRa radios. Cattle localization is designed to prevent theft in livestock. The proposed solution decreases the cost of cattle localization by minimizing the number of collars with GPS and allows accurate localization of collars without GPS. We propose a RSSI-based distance estimation using realtime adjustment of RSSI-distance mapping taking advantage of communication between collar nodes and gateway. Log-distance path-loss model is also used as rescue when the map does not provide accurate correspondence. Experimentation results show the validity of the approach with highly accurate localization of non-GPS collars.},

In this work, we examine the performance of LoRa in the presence of both additive white Gaussian noise and interference from another LoRa user. To this end, we extend an existing interference model, which assumes perfect alignment of the signal of interest and the interference, to the more realistic case where the interfering user is neither chip- nor phase-aligned with the signal of interest and we derive an expression for the error rate. We show that the existing aligned interference model overestimates the effect of interference on the error rate. Moreover, we prove two symmetries in the interfering signal and we derive low-complexity approximate formulas that can significantly reduce the complexity of computing the symbol and frame error rates compared to the complete expression. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to corroborate the theoretical analysis and to verify the accuracy of our proposed approximations.},

To fully exploit the potential of location awareness and enable new advanced location-based services, localization algorithms need to be combined with complementary technologies including accurate height estimation, i.e., three dimensional location, reliable user mobility classification, and efficient indoor mapping solutions. This survey provides a comprehensive review of such enabling technologies. In particular, we present cellular localization systems including recent results on 5G localization, and solutions based on wireless local area networks, highlighting those that are capable of computing 3D location in multi-floor indoor environments. We overview range-free localization schemes, which have been traditionally explored in wireless sensor networks and are nowadays gaining attention for several envisioned Internet of Things applications. We also present user mobility estimation techniques, particularly those applicable in cellular networks, that can improve localization and tracking accuracy. Regarding the mapping of physical space inside buildings for aiding tracking and navigation applications, we study recent advances and focus on smartphone-based indoor simultaneous localization and mapping approaches. The survey concludes with service availability and system scalability considerations, as well as security and privacy concerns in location architectures, discusses the technology roadmap, and identifies future research directions.},

IoT arises from the vast need to monitor, manage, and configure “things” remotely. Different industrial or residential applications can use IoT to obtain or send data, such as remote control of alarms, water meters, simple traffic, and light points. This research project focuses on the IoT implementation of devices LoRa that uses the LoRaWAN protocol. LoRaWAN is a network infrastructure that could be applied to monitor different variables in environments where IoT wireless technology is implemented. The current project involves designing a LoRaWAN network to support IoT in transporting school routes in Barranquilla's southwest. The project incorporates a prototype that allows the vehicle monitoring, geographical location in real-time, percentage of the occupation, arrivals, and departures times, among other variables. Implementing this technology in the chosen sector will benefit families that require the school transport service because they will monitor the operation of the service provided. This paper details the devices and technology to be implemented in the final prototype, specifying their topology, application, technical specification, operating characteristics, and their configuration and work logic under different scenarios. For the development of the project, the guidelines defined in each of the Top-Down network design methodology phases are applied. Finally, two essential aspects are shown, such as analyzing the results obtained in the tests and the future work to be carried out based on the research.},

Where mineworkers could keep smartphones with them, they can be highly effective at enabling localization and navigation.

Localization techniques are used to determine the geographical position of sensor nodes. The position parameters of sensor nodes are also useful for many operations for network management, such as routing process, topology control, and security maintenance. So, it is very important that every node should reports its location information very accurately. As we know that GPS is very accurate in location determination but it is expensive in terms of cost and energy of nodes, so it is not useful in WSNs. There are so many localization techniques, including range-based and range-free, have been proposed to calculate positions for randomly deployed sensor nodes. Accuracy of localization techniques is most important before implementing it. With specific hardware, the range-based schemes typically achieve high accuracy based on either nodeto-node distances or angles. In this paper, our main focus is on the range-based localization. Precisely, in order to helps the network designers to find out which techniques/algorithms are suitable for their applications, the most popular range-based localization techniques are classified and compared.},

We derive CRBs and maximum-likelihood estimators (MLEs) under Gaussian and log-normal models for the TOA and RSS measurements, respectively. An extensive TOA and RSS measurement campaign in an indoor office area illustrates MLE performance.

Specifically, we examine empirical propagation models commonly employed in communication systems, assessing their applicability across various environments such as outdoor, indoor, and within vegetation. Our investigation underscores the prevalence of logarithmic decay in most empirical models. In addition, we survey the relationship between model parameters and environmental factors, clearing their nuanced interplay. Analyzing published measurement results, we extract the log-distance model parameters to decipher environmental influences comprehensively. Drawing insights from published measurement results for LoRa, we compare them with the model’s outcomes, highlighting successes and limitations. We additionally explore the application of multi-slope models to LoRa measurements to evaluate its effectiveness in enhancing the accuracy of path loss prediction.

In this article, we prove by experimental results that the long-range (LoRa) low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology is very promising for SaR applications due to its extended radio range. A LoRa-based system for SaR operations is presented and analyzed. The localization of the persons is obtained through an algorithm based on path-loss (PL) measurements. Radio PL models of body-worn LoRa devices in harsh mountain environments are derived by measurements. We observed that although the communication range of LoRa decreases from kilometers to hundreds of meters in the tested environments, at least 50\% of the transmitted packets can be received at distances about five times greater than those achievable with golden standard technologies such as ARVA. The performances of the considered localization algorithm are analyzed on the basis of the collected data. The achievable accuracy is in the order of meters around the true position for a relatively large number of available PL measurements. Finally, we propose and detail a LoRa-based system for SaR operations.},

LoRa is one of the most prominent technologies in the Internet of Things industry, primarily due to its ability to achieve long-distance transmission while consuming less power. In this work, we modeled different environments and assessed the performances of networks by observing the effects of various factors and network parameters. The path loss model, the deployment area size, the transmission power, the spreading factor, the number of nodes and gateways, and the antenna gain have a significant effect on the main performance metrics such as the energy consumption and the data extraction rate of a LoRa network. In order to examine these parameters, we performed simulations in OMNeT++ using the open source framework FLoRa. The scenarios which were investigated in this work include the simulation of rural and urban environments and a parking area model. The results indicate that the optimization of the key parameters could have a huge impact on the deployment of smart networks.},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication in the course of the last decade, the importance of low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies intensifies. However, the abundance of accurate propagation models proposed for these systems by standardization bodies, vendors, and research community hampers the deployment planning. In this paper, we question the selection of accurate propagation models for Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), LoRaWAN, and Sigfox LPWAN technologies, based on extensive measurement campaign in two mid-size European cities. Our results demonstrate that none of the state-of-the-art models can accurately describe the propagation of LPWAN radio signals in an urban environment. For this reason, we propose enhancements to the selected models based on our experimental measurements. Performing the fine-tuning of the propagation models for one of the cities, we select Ericsson Urban (NB-IoT, LoRaWAN) and 3GPP (Sigfox) models as the ones providing the closest match. Finally, we proceed to perform cross-validation of the propagation models using the data set for another city. The tuned models demonstrate an excellent match with the real data in the cross-validation phase. They outperform their competitors by at least 20-80\% in terms of relative deviation from the measured signal levels presenting the accurate option for NB-IoT, LoRaWAN, and Sigfox deployments planning in mid-size cities.},

Cars to be tracked are fitted with battery- powered tags that send each other plain LoRa messages and then report over LoRaWAN the observed RSSI to the server. The server estimates tag coordinates using multi-dimensional scaling and a novel corrective transformation based on tag clustering. We designed a low-cost tag for RSSI measurement and an energy efficient solution for managing a mesh of 1000 tags on one site using time division multiplexing. The tags are fully controlled and synchronized by the server. To stay synchronized for several hours until a next downlink the tags estimate and compensate the real-time clock error. Large-scale tests are yet to be performed, but lab-based and small-scale tests in real conditions show a maximal error of 8 meters and a battery lifetime of 5 years.},

	abstract = {Although Global Positioning System (GPS) is widely used in outdoor location-based services, it still lacks precision due to obstacles that reduce its performance, such as near tall buildings, with bad weather conditions, and under tree canopies. In some situations, inaccurate localization or delay in getting location locks can adversely affect some location-based services’ functionality. Furthermore, it might make these services less efficient or even completely useless, especially when the receiver device has no SIM card or when the service requires a precision higher than three meters. As a solution to this issue, this study designs, develops, and evaluates a prototype location-based system that uses Bluetooth Low Energy beacons for short-range positioning in outdoor environments as a GPS alternative. The proposed system is a game that includes navigational tasks, which can be accomplished by reaching the proximity of two meters from the beacon’s location. The study involved conducting an experiment outdoors with a focus on areas where GPS signals are degraded to assess our proposed system’s efficiency and feasibility compared to the usage of GPS. The results proved BLE beacons’ ability to provide better positioning results than GPS, not only in terms of accuracy but also in terms of stability of positioning results over time. Based on the findings, the study outlines a set of guidelines to be considered in choosing a suitable positioning technology.},

The recent introduction of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio protocol provides new opportunities for indoor location. It supports portable battery-powered beacons that can be easily distributed at low cost, giving it distinct advantages over WiFi. However, its differing use of the radio band brings new challenges too. In this work, we provide a detailed study of BLE fingerprinting using 19 beacons distributed around a 600 m2 testbed to position a consumer device. We demonstrate the high susceptibility of BLE to fast fading, show how to mitigate this, and quantify the true power cost of continuous BLE scanning. We further investigate the choice of key parameters in a BLE positioning system, including beacon density, transmit power, and transmit frequency. We also provide quantitative comparison with WiFi fingerprinting. Our results show advantages to the use of BLE beacons for positioning. For one-shot (push-to-fix) positioning we achieve {\textless}; 2.6 m error 95\% of the time for a dense BLE network (1 beacon per 30 m2), compared to {\textless}; 4.8 m for a reduced density (1 beacon per 100 m2) and {\textless}; 8.5 m for an established WiFi network in the same area.},

In wireless systems, a very popular ranging method makes use of the radio signal strength (RSS), which is a measure of the received radio signal power. However, RSS-based ranging is considered very inaccurate, particularly in indoor environments, mainly because of the randomness of the received signal power. In this tutorial paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the main factors that affect the variability of the received signal power and the accuracy of the RSS measurements. Starting from a survey of the most common and widely accepted models for the radio signal propagation and the RSS-based ranging, we then focus our attention on some technological and procedural pitfalls that are often overlooked, but may significantly affect the accuracy of the RSS-based ranging, and we suggest possible techniques to alleviate such problems. The theoretical argumentation is backed up by a set of empirical results in different scenarios. We conclude this paper by providing some best-practice recommendations for proper RSS-based ranging estimation in wireless networks and discussing new approaches and open research challenges.},

	abstract = {LoRa is based on Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) technology, where chirps (also known as symbols) are the carrier of data.
The spreading factor controls the chirp rate, and thus controls the speed of data transmission. Lower spreading factors mean faster chirps and therefore a higher data transmission rate. For every increase in spreading factor, the chirp sweep rate is halved, and so the data transmission rate is halved.
For a visual explanation, see this video on LoRa chirps.},

	abstract = {LoRaWAN is a flagship Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology that has highly attracted much attention from the community in recent years. Many LoRaWAN end-devices, such as sensors or actuators, are expected not to be powered by the electricity grid; therefore, it is crucial to investigate the energy consumption of LoRaWAN. However, published works have only focused on this topic to a limited extent. In this paper, we present analytical models that allow the characterization of LoRaWAN end-device current consumption, lifetime and energy cost of data delivery. The models, which have been derived based on measurements on a currently prevalent LoRaWAN hardware platform, allow us to quantify the impact of relevant physical and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer LoRaWAN parameters and mechanisms, as well as Bit Error Rate (BER) and collisions, on energy performance. Among others, evaluation results show that an appropriately configured LoRaWAN end-device platform powered by a battery of 2400 mAh can achieve a 1-year lifetime while sending one message every 5 min, and an asymptotic theoretical lifetime of 6 years for infrequent communication.},

	abstract = {Localization has been a major challenge in wireless sensor networks. The data reported from a sensor is only useful when the position of that sensor is found. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that accurately localizes sensors while minimizing their power consumption and memory requirements. The proposed algorithm splits the task of localization between sensor nodes and the base station (i.e., sink) and does not necessitate the presence of many anchor nodes (nodes with preconfigured positions). It recommends placing the anchors in a circle or a semi-circle around the perimeter of the WSN. Not only this placement strategy leads to more accurate localization, but it is also very convenient for WSNs used for environment monitoring, military surveillance, or tracking applications. The proposed approach can also be tailored to route the sensed data to the base station which alleviates the sensors from the overhead incurred in establishing routes to the base station. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated and compared to other peer algorithms using the network simulator (NS-2). Results show that significant enhancement is obtained with the proposed algorithm when measuring metrics such as energy and localization error while varying other simulation parameters such as the number of sensors and the area size.},

	abstract = {Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) are nowadays taking a prominent place in Machine To Machine/Internet of Things domain. LoRa outdoor performance within Dakar peninsula, which covers a ground area of 83 Km2, was evaluated based on real-life measurements. The measurements were performed with LoRa stations working in the 868MHz ISM band using 14dBm transmit power. Afterwards, by considering a spreading factor of 12, we observed a maximum communication range up to 10km with a good Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). Based on the collected dataset, firstly we design a channel attenuation model in order to estimate path loss. Secondly, We present a coverage-based model in which we use the results of the channel attenuation model. The obtained results show that if we fix a -120dBm maximum tolerated RSSI, Dakar peninsula could be fully covered with almost 40\% Packet Error rate (PER). Furthermore, with -110dBm maximum tolerated RSSI, the PER is 20\% but the whole city won't be covered. Another base station should be added in order to have a total coverage.},
