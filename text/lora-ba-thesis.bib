	abstract = {The introduction of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to the public has provided millions of people with navigation and positioning services around the globe. However, it is known that no matter the improvements to accuracy, fundamentally, GPS cannot provide location information in extreme environments, such as underwater and underground. Hence, there is a growing need for alternative technologies and methodologies of providing localization in such extreme or GPSless environments. This paper introduces a low-power and lowcost substitute founded on Long Range (LoRa) to realize similar localization capabilities, based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) techniques. LoRa transceivers support swift deployment in GPS-less emergency scenarios, providing emergency teams with critical location and sensing data. According to outdoor experimental results, LoRa is a promising solution for wireless localization systems at GPS-less environments.},

The proposed hardware is generic, and it can estimate the AoA of any received signal that is operating at a frequency below 2.7 GHz. However, we have validated its performance with LoRa signals that are operating at the 868 MHz frequency band. The experimental validation, which has been conducted in a controlled environment, reveals that the proposed system can estimate the AoA of the received signals from various azimuth angles with median and maximum estimation errors of 4 and 14 degrees, respectively.},

Real Time Kinematic (RTK) is a promising technology to achieve centimeter precision in GNSS, however it requires radio communication and to reduce power consumption this is done at meters range, reducing the use in navigation systems. In this work, we present a high precision low power systems that can be energetically autonomous. The proposed approach exploits a GNSS module with RTK combined with a long-range communication radio (LoRa) to achieve a high-precision localization system with minimal wireless radio infrastructure requirements. Wireless sensor nodes, designed to be energy efficient, comprise the system and they include a solar energy harvesting for self-sustainability. Preliminary experimental results, with in-field measurements, show an average accuracy below 1 meter up to more than 1km distance of the end-node from the geostationary reference anchor; with a peak accuracy of only 10cm. Low power consumption is also presented with in-filed measurements.},

The reliability and usability of such systems are highly based on their accuracy as well as cost and ease of deployment. Although the Global Positioning System (GPS) is an accurate solution for outdoor use, it can not be used indoors. A popular approach is a wireless navigation system which makes use of Received Signal Strength Indicators (RSSI). However, signal propagation, as well as surrounding noise and a dynamic environment, can affect their performance. Recent advancements in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and the introduction of small and inexpensive beacons can alleviate the problem. In this work, we introduce an indoor navigation system with BLE beacons. To measure system accuracy an Android application was developed to collect the signal. Moreover, a Kalman filter was also developed within the application to improve the accuracy. Experimental results showed improvement of systems accuracy in three square topologies. The Kalman filter improved the accuracy up to 78.9\%. while the experiments also show a correlation between the overall accuracy and how close BLE beacons are to each other.},

	abstract = {The last few years have seen a rapid expansion within the area of the Internet ofThings (IoT). For many IoT applications, such as asset tracking and distributedsensor networks, the problem of localization (i.e. determining the physical loca-tion of nodes in the network) is fundamental. For such applications, constraintson size, cost, and power consumption often prohibit the use of GPS. This thesisdesigns, implements, and evaluates a GPS-free localization system using the LongRange Radio (LoRa) technology, built using low cost off-the-shelf hardware. Thesystem is based on combining Time of Flight (ToF) and Received Signal StrengthIndicator (RSSI) distance measurements using a weighted multilateration estima-tor. By using an accelerometer that detects significant movement, subsequentmeasurements made in the same place can be leveraged to provide increased ac-curacy. The evaluation shows that the hybrid system outperforms both ToF andRSSI used on their own, achieving a mean stationary position error of 272 meters,which is comparable to other LoRa localization techniques.},

Most of the range-based localization algorithms proposed made use of the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) to make an estimation of the distance between transmitter and receiver. Based on our experiments, there is no relationship between RSSI and distance in indoor situations. But the outdoor experiments show that RSSI is closely related with distance, direction of antenna, the height of nodes above the ground and obstructions. The Gaussian model by curve fitting the average RSSI value with distance resulted the formulation that can be used to compute the distance between unknown node and its neighboring nodes. Then, by applying Trilateration method, a localization system was implemented. This system are specially designed for outdoor without obstructions, tiny variance of physical conditions and all sensor nodes should be placed 2 meters higher than playground. Finally, some errors were analyzed in detail and corresponding proposals were given.},

New use cases are being created by the need for it and feasibility to provide it, with low-cost solutions. As a key enabler of the IoT, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is gaining great attention in research and industry. It provides a desirable solution for applications that require hundreds or thousands of actively connected devices to monitor a process or an environment or to assist in controlling a certain process. Some of these IoT use cases require having the location information of the IoT devices. In some cases, localization can be the intrinsic purpose of deployment. In this regard, the received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based localization offers a feasible and affordable solution. Since LoRaWAN has only been there for only a few years, research on utilizing LoRaWAN RSSI for localization purposes is in early stages and is scarce. In this paper, we study LoRaWAN RSSI-based localization and evaluate its accuracy, impairments, and prospects. In addition, we employ the use of software-defined radios (SDR) into our work for the purpose of path-loss characterization. The experimental results revealed the fact that a high variance of RSSI due to frequency hopping feature of LoRaWAN could severely impact the localization performance. Potential solutions are developed and presented to reduce this negative impact, hence improve the performance.},

We use a publicly available outdoor LoRaWAN data set to evaluate Received Signal Strength fingerprint-based and range-based location estimation algorithms in terms of accuracy and computational performance. On the one hand, a fingerprint-based approach leads to 50\% more accurate results when compared to a range-based approach, resulting in mean location estimation errors of 340m and 700m, respectively. On the other hand, in a range-based approach, no training database is required and the system can be deployed instantly in any environment with network coverage.

	abstract = {Tracking of goods, containers, and vehicles in harbors is a challenging task because seaports typically are in a secluded area with limited networking capability. Existing solutions use the combination of RFID tagging and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). A harbor is considered a harsh industrial environment with metallic components and surfaces. These conditions inﬂuence the wireless networking performance. In addition, harbors’ areas vary from 500 ha to 7500 ha. Hence, the coverage range of wireless systems and the exposition to interference are considered. LoRa (Long Range) technology becomes a promising solution among other Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). Therefore, we investigate the LoRa technology to locate and track assets in harbors. Through ns3 simulations on scalability, interval rate, and coverage range performance metrics, we evaluated the feasibility to use LoRa in seaports. In our experiments, we applied 1000 LoRa nodes within a radius of 2500 m to the gateway. The results exhibit a probability of successful transmission of 85\% in an interval of 300 sec.},

In this paper, the LoRa technology is investigated for the implementation of industrial wireless networks suitable for sensors and actuators of the Industry 4.0 era. After a brief overview of LoRa and LoRaWAN, the paper deals with the discussion about using LoRa for industrial applications compared to traditional industrial wireless systems. With only very light modifications to the upper layer of LoRaWAN communication stack, a time slot channel hopping schema is possible. The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approach, which is compatible with requirements of soft real-time applications in process industry. In particular, proper time, frequency, and spreading factor planning may allow 6000 nodes accessed up to one minute cycle time.},

advancements provides people handheld devices and indoor robots, which increase

use the technology for Indoor Localization, we study its ranging performance with
several LoRa modulation parameters considering different scenarios.
In this thesis, we present a ranging evaluation system and indoor localization system.
The evaluation system enriches us with suitable LoRa parameter for indoor envi-

evaluation gives a brief perspective about LoRa modulation parameters in different
scenarios. Also, the indoor localization system’s performance is largely dependent
on ranging performance of LoRa devices. Additionally, our evaluation shows that

	abstract = {Smartphone devices can play a key role on emergency scenarios thanks to their pervasiveness, and the possibility to convey emergency requests from the involved people to the rescue teams. At the same time, the effective utilization of such devices on critical scenarios with limited mobile Internet access is challenging. As an alternative, several recent research studies have proposed Emergency Communication System (ECS) based on short-range Device-to-Device (D2D) solutions available on Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) devices (e.g. Wi-Fi Direct); however, the target of these solutions is constituted by small indoor areas, since the scalability on large-scale environments is often a problem. In this paper, we overcome such issue by proposing LOCATE, a novel phone-based ECS enabling long-range communication among survivors and rescue teams over critical environments where 3/4G cellular connectivity is not available and the traditional geo-localization technologies (e.g. the GPS) provide only partial coverage of the environment. The proposed system consists of a mobile application connected to a LoRa transceiver via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); through the app, users can send emergency requests that are re-broadcasted by other peers until reaching a rescue personnel who is able to handle the emergency. Three novel contributions are provided in this paper. First, we provide extensive measurements of the LoRa technology, and investigate its suitability for ECS-related applications. Second, we describe the LOCATE prototype and the enabling algorithms; specifically, we propose a novel multi-hop dissemination algorithm which maximizes the probability to deliver an emergency request to the destination (e.g. rescue personnel) within a user-defined temporal threshold, while minimizing the number of message re-transmissions. Third, we extensively evaluate the LOCATE performance through OMNeT++ simulations, assessing the capability of the dissemination protocol to spread out the emergency requests over large-scale scenarios, and through experiments, assessing the capability of LoRa-based trilateration technique to provide accurate GPS-free localization. The results demonstrate that the LOCATE protocol is able to minimize the time required to handle the emergency when compared to other dissemination strategies (e.g. flooding, continuous, once-per-contact), and they highlight the considerable improvement provided by the LoRa technology over other D2D solutions available on COTS smartphones (e.g. Wi-Fi Direct).},

	abstract = {Maritime communications are really challenging due to the adverse transmission conditions and the lack of a pre-provided infrastructure for supporting long range connectivity with land. Communications in high seas are usually covered by satellite links that are expensive and lead to high power consumption by the terminals. However, in areas closer to the shore, other communication options have been adopted for different kinds of services such as boat tracking and telemetry, data collection from moored monitoring systems, etc. In these scenarios, technologies such as cellular communications or wireless sensor networks have been employed so far; nevertheless, all of them present different drawbacks mostly related with the coverage and energy-efficiency of the system. Recently, a novel communication paradigm, so-called Low Power-Wide Area Network (LP-WAN) has gained momentum due to its interesting characteristics regarding transmission distances and end-node’s power consumption. The latter may be of great interest for ships with energetic restrictions such as small sailboats, recreational boats, or radio control ships. For that reason, in this work, we present a boat tracking and monitoring system based on LoRa (Long Range), one of the most prominent LP-WAN technologies. We provide a comprehensive overview of this communication solution as well as a discussion addressing its benefits when applied to maritime scenarios. We present the results extracted from a case of study, where real-training sessions of Optimist Class sailboats have been monitored by means of the presented architecture, obtaining good levels of coverage and link-reliability with limited power consumption. A transmission range study is also presented, demonstrating the validity of this proposal for monitoring activities inside the port or maneuvers close to the shore.},

	abstract = {The positioning task of the Internet of Things (IoT) for outdoor environments requires that the node devices meet the requirements of low power consumption, long endurance, and low cost and that the positioning system can achieve high-precision positioning and wide-area coverage. Considering that traditional IoT positioning technology cannot balance the cost, energy consumption, and positioning performance well, a Wide-Area Positioning System Based on Long Range Mesh (LoRaWAPS), which is a low-cost and low-power outdoor positioning system with multi-anchor wireless mesh networking and multi-dimensional data fusion, is designed in this paper. To meet the need for a positioning system, a low-power consumption and high-reliability LoRa Mesh protocol is proposed. Aiming at the problem that the accuracy of LoRa ranging is easily affected by the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) path propagation of signals, a distance estimation algorithm based on the fusion of time of flight (TOF) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) multi-sampling data is proposed. Furthermore, a position estimation algorithm is designed to minimize the posteriori RSSI error for multi-anchor cooperative estimation scenarios. Furthermore, the prototype of LoRaWAPS is built and tested in the campus environment. The experimental results show that the proposed system can provide reliable location service with low power and low cost.},

The algorithm, through a comprehensive examination of the phase change patterns, amalgamated with arrival angle data and signal amplitude characteristics, effectively estimates the precise location of the target. Experimental validations underscore the algorithm’s efficacy in determining the target’s location during continuous walking activity.

WSN has the capability to collect and report data for a specific application. The location information plays an important role for various wireless sensor network applications. A majority of the applications are related to location-based services. The development of sensor technology, processing techniques, and communication systems give rise to a development of the smart sensor for the adaptive and innovative application. So a single localization technique is not adequate for all application. In this paper, a recent extensive analysis of localization techniques and hierarchical taxonomy and their applications in the different context is presented. This taxonomy of the localization technique is classified based on presence of offline training in localization, namely self-determining and training dependent approaches.

Ambient assisted living technologies can help in mitigating the need for continuous supervision, enabling the elderly to easily look for help in case of emergency. In this work, the well-known and widespread LoRaWAN communication infrastructure is evaluated for possible complementing indoor and outdoor positioning solutions, in order to alert a remotely-connected caregiver about accidents (e.g., falls). The choice of LoRaWAN is dictated by the capability to implement both private and public infrastructures. Satellite-based systems are addressed for outdoor localization, whereas the demanding task of indoor localization is solved by means of Ultra Wide Band technology. Results demonstrated sub-meter error in a typical indoor scenario, with average communication latency on the order of 700 ms.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a RSSI-based distance estimation scheme for localization of cattle collars communicating with long-range LoRa radios. Cattle localization is designed to prevent theft in livestock. The proposed solution decreases the cost of cattle localization by minimizing the number of collars with GPS and allows accurate localization of collars without GPS. We propose a RSSI-based distance estimation using realtime adjustment of RSSI-distance mapping taking advantage of communication between collar nodes and gateway. Log-distance path-loss model is also used as rescue when the map does not provide accurate correspondence. Experimentation results show the validity of the approach with highly accurate localization of non-GPS collars.},
